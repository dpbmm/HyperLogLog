## HyperLogLog

The HyperLogLog algorithm estimates the cardinality (number of unique elements) of a very large multiset.

See [original paper](algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf) by Philippe Flajolet, Éric Fusy, Olivier Genouet, and Frédéric Meunier.

We intend to implement a [revised version](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/40671.pdf) of this algorithm by Stefan Heule, Marc Nunkesser, and Alexander Hall.

This coding project is collaborative work among Jawad Stouli, David Branner, and Himanish Kushary.
